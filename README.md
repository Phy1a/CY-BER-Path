This code is basically a strategic game, I'll let u discover it if you wish.

Make sure to compile everything like this :

For windows : 

`gcc main.c lib/utils.c lib/map.c lib/tile.c lib/game.c -o my_program`

Check file paths if you encounter any error.

For linux :

`gcc -o my_programm main.c lib/utils.c lib/map.c lib/tile.c lib/game.c`


It doesn't need any special extention except for a C code runner and all the files contained in lib's folder, include's folder and main.c.
