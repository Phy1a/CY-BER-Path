This code is basically a strategic game, I'll let u discover it if you wish.

Make sure to compile everything like this :

For windows : 

    gcc main.c lib/utils.c lib/map.c lib/tile.c lib/game.c -o my_program

Check file paths if you encounter any error.

For linux :

    gcc -o my_programm main.c lib/utils.c lib/map.c lib/tile.c lib/game.c


It doesn't need any special extention except for a C code runner and all the files contained in lib's folder, include's folder and main.c.

This program generates a game in which several players play, the aim being to reach a randomly designated target with the minimum number of moves. The player with the minimum number of moves goes first, if he reaches for his target with the right number he gets: otherwise, if he reaches but with a different number he only gets one point . And if he doesn't reach his target, everyone takes a point exept him. The difficulty of the game is that the robot moves in a straight line and stops only when it encounters a wall, another robot or another target.

The right reading order to read and understand the program : 
- tile.c
- map.c
- game.c
- utile.c
- main.c

FONCTION USE IN THESE FILES :

  FOR TILE.C :
  
    This file implements the functions declared in the `tile. h' header file. Here is an explanation 
    detailed for each function: 
    
    1. **'create_tile' function:** - This function creates a tile with default walls not present (`0'), no robot (`64'), and 
    no target (`0'). 
    
    2. **Better_tile function:** - This function adjusts the walls of a tile for a cleaner display. - assigns a value of -1 to walls that are already represented      by the adjacent tile wall. 
    
    3. **`print_colored' function:** - This function displays a color string. - Uses ANSI color codes on Linux systems and library functions 
    Windows (GetStdHandle and SetConsoleTextAttribute) on Windows. 
    
    4. **Functions `print_tile1', `print_tile2', `print_tile3`:** - These functions display the first, second and third row of a tile, respectively.
    
    - They take into account the walls and special elements (robot, target) present on the tile. - They use print_colored to display text in colour according to         the platform. 
    These functions are crucial for the visual representation of tiles in the game. They allow 
    correctly initialize a tile, adjust it for optimal display and display each part 
    tile with appropriate elements, such as walls, robots and targets. 

FOR MAP.C :

    implementation of functions declared in the `map. h' header file.  

    1. **`create_map' function:** - This function creates a game map by filling each tile with default values at 
    using create_tile then adjusting the walls around each tile with better_tile. - It also adds walls to the edges of the card. 
    
    2. **`print_row function:** - This function displays a line from the map on the screen. - It scans each column in the row and displays each tile using the 
    functions 
    print_tile1, print_tile2 and print_tile3 for each part of the tile. - It also manages the display of walls between lines.
    
    3. **Function `print_map:** - This function displays the complete map by calling `print_row' for each line of the map. 
    
    4. **Function `is_wall:** - This function checks if a tile has a wall in a specific direction. - Returns 1 if a wall is present and 0 if not. 
    
    5. **add_wall function:** - This function adds a wall to a tile in a specific direction. - It also updates the walls of the adjacent tile based on the             direction of the added wall. 
    
    6. **Function `is_target_validÂ¿ :** - This function checks if a given position is valid to place a target. - Checks that the target is not in contact with         other targets or random walls. 
    
    7. **Random_wall function:** - This function fills an array with random coordinates for walls. 
    
    8. **`add_map_side_walls' function:** - This function adds walls to the sides of the board. 
    
    9. **`add_map_target' function:** - This function adds targets to the map by choosing valid positions. 
    
    10. **`add_map_robot' function:** - This function adds robots to the map by choosing valid positions. 
    
    These functions are essential for creating, displaying and manipulating the card in the game. 
    They are the basis of the functioning of the the interaction of players with the gaming environment. 

FOR GAME.C : 

    a C implementation of the functions declared in the `game. h' header file.  
    
    1. **Motion functions ('go_up', 'go_right', 'go_down', 'go_left'):** - These functions move a robot on the map in different directions: upwards, to the right,     to the bottom and left. - They first check if there is no wall or other robot in the next box, then 
    move the robot accordingly. - Each function uses a recursive approach to allow the robot to move as long as it 
    is no obstacle. 
    
    2. **`print_scores' function:** - Displays player scores on screen. - Scans the scoreboard and displays each score with the corresponding player ID. 
    
    3. **Function `print_winner:** - Determines the winner or winners based on scores. - Finds the maximum score among all players. - Identifies players with this     maximum score and displays them as winners. - In the event of a tie, all players with the maximum score are designated as winners. 
    
    4. **Using dynamic memory:** - The `print_winner' function uses dynamic memory allocation to store indexes of 
    players with the maximum score. - This memory is released at the end of the function to avoid memory leaks. 
    
    These functions are an essential logical part of movement management and 
    determining scores and the winner in the game.
